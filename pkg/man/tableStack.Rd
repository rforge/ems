\description{
There are two functionalities: Tabulation of variables with the same possible range of distribution and stack into a new table with or without other descriptive statistics or to breakdown distribution of more than one row variables against a column variable
}
\details{
This function is a clone of \code{tableStack} from the \code{epiDisplay} package. Comparing to the original, tt adds options to show the NA in the variables as categories, similar to the option \code{useNA} in the \code{table} function, and it also fix few bugs, such as showing the \code{total.column} without the need to \code{test = TRUE}, and to show or hide levels with zero counts without returning error.

This function simultaneously explores several variables with a fixed integer rating scale. For non-factor variables, the default values for tabulation are the minimum and the maximum of all variables but can be specified by the user.

When 'by' is omitted, all variables must be of the same class, and must be 'integer', 'factor' or 'logical. Some parameters are only used if by is omitted, others are only used if by is available. The by-omitted dependent variable are minlevel, maxlevel, count, na.rm, means, medians, sds, total, reverse, vars.to.reverse. The by-available dependent variables are iqr, prevalence, percent, frequency, test, name.test, total.column, simulate.p.value, sample.size, assumption.p.value, NArow, NAcol, drplvls.
Unlike function 'alpha', the argument 'reverse' has a default value of FALSE. This argument is ignored if 'vars.to.reverse' is specified.

Options for 'reverse', 'vars.to.reverse' and statistics of 'means', 'medians', 'sds' and 'total' are available only if the items are not factor. To obtain statistics of factor items, users need to use 'unclassDataframe' to convert them into integer.

When the 'by' argument is given, 'reverse' and 'vars.to.reverse' do not apply, as mentioned before. Instead, columns of the 'by' variable will be formed. A table will be created against each selected variable. If the variable is a factor or coerced to factor with 'vars.to.factor', cross-tabulation will result with percents as specified, ie. "column", "row", or "none" (FALSE). For a dichotomous row variable, if set to 'TRUE', the prevalence of row variable in the form of a fraction is displayed in each subgroup column. For objects of class 'numeric' or 'integer', means with standard deviations will be displayed. For variables with residuals that are not normally distributed or where the variance of subgroups are significantly not normally distributed (using a significance level of 0.01), medians and inter-quartile ranges will be presented if the argument 'iqr' is set to "auto" (by default). Users may specify a subset of the selected variables (from the 'vars' argument) to be presented in such a form. Otherwise, the argument could be set as any other character string, except the variables names, to insist to present means and standard deviations.

When 'test = TRUE' (default), Pearson's chi-squared test (or a two-sided Fisher's exact test, if the sample size is small) will be carried out for a categorical variable or a factor. Parametric or non-parametric comparison and test will be carried out for a object of class 'numeric' or 'integer' (See 'iqr' and 'assumption.p.value' below). If the sample size of the numeric variable is too small in any group, the test is omitted and the problem reported.

For Fisher's exact test, the default method employs 'simulate.p.value = FALSE'. See further explanation in 'fisher.test' procedure. If the dataset is extraordinarily large, the option may be manually set to TRUE.

When 'by' is specified as a single character object (such as 'by="none"') or when 'by = NONE' there will be no column breakdown and all tests will be omitted. Only the total column is displayed. Only the 'total' column is shown.

If this 'total column' is to accompany the 'by' breakdown, the argument 'total.column=TRUE' should be specified. The 'sample.size' is TRUE by default. The total number of records for each group is displayed in the first row of the output. However, the variable in each row may have some missing records, the information on which is reported by NArow for each variable on 'vars' and by NAcol for the variable on 'by'.

By default, Epicalc sets 'var.labels=TRUE' in order to give nice output. However, 'var.labels=FALSE' can sometimes be more useful during data exploration. Variable numbers as well as variable names are displayed instead of variable labels. Names and numbers of abnormally distributed variables, especially factors with too many levels, can be easily identified for further relevelling or recoding.

The argument 'iqr' has a default value being "auto". Non-parametric comparison and test will be automatically chosen if Bartlett's test P value is below the 'assumption.p.value'.

The test can be forced to parametric by setting 'iqr=NULL' and to non-parametric by if iqr is set to the variable number of cont.var (See examples.).
